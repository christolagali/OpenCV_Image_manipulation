# OpenCV_Image_manipulation
This is simple Java Application that displays openCV techniques of Image Manipulation like:
1. Contrast Strecthing (Increasing contrast of an image)
2. Edge Detection using Sobel Algorithm(Finding out Edges in an Image)
3. Thresholding (with a specified value)
4. Negative of an Image

These techniques were performed by converting the Image to a byte stream to manipulate each pixel at a time. 
No OpenCV Functions were used to study how each technique differed.
